(Most of) My Configuration Files

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Currently in use on Arch Linux

These are the dotfiles that I use on my GNU/Linux system. The main focus of these files is to create a functional, secure, fast, extensible and intuitive system. I expect to achieve this by means of free (as in freedom, obviously) software, minimalism, simplicity and Vim-like keybindings, so this is what you can expect to find here. If you didn't guess it by now, (at least some of the programs used and) the dotfiles in this repository are HEAVILY inspired by Luke Smith's "Voidrice" (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice), as I think it follows the kind of workflow "philosophy" that I want to adopt. Have fun if you want to try these files out, but don't expect them to work on your system, despite the fact that I actively use them.

WARNING: These configuration folders include symlinks in order to move some files away from their standard location (e.g. newsboat urls) or need symlinks to work (e.g. librewolf will not look by default to the overrides in .config/my-librewolf, it needs a symlink to do that).
